I work closely with them to identify the best resources for learning—whether that’s free online courses, coding tutorials, or open-source projects—and assist them in setting up their coding environments, ensuring they have the tools they need to succeed. I take a hands-on approach in troubleshooting technical issues, answering questions, and breaking down complex concepts into manageable steps. Outside of prison, I continue offering support by connecting them with job opportunities, internships, and additional educational resources, helping them build a path toward a career in tech. Through this mentorship, I aim to provide more than just technical skills; I help build confidence, motivation, and a sense of purpose, empowering individuals to transform their lives through coding.",
